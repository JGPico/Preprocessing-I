        <h2>Cool stuff about me</h2>
        <p>
          Life is either a daring adventure or nothing. . . I'm not sure which, but at least I've narrowed it down.
          I'm rich with life experiences, but have had trouble exchanging them for goods and services.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Times have been hard. To save on money, I moved out of my old apartment and into a luxurious ravine.
          I didn't like that apartment anyway; it was always getting looted and never at a reasonable hour.
          And if it wasn't looters it was the solicitors, or sometimes both would come at once,
          and there wouldn't be enough chairs. The ravine is great; you get lots of sun,
          and you can just drop garbage wherever you want.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually,
          but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg pennies from the locals,
          and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes.
          You're quietly conquering the world, minding your own business, when suddenly the repo man comes,
          or looters, you find yourself on the street, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage
          as the storm passes through. Still, I am sure that, as always, I'll triumph over this adversity,
          or at least do slightly better than everyone else.
